# Video Game Release Calendar

I wanted a way to quickly see what games are coming out without having to faff around, visiting multiple sites to check if they're correct. I also wanted it dead simple, easy to read and easy to find games. This is that attempt.

It pulls content from multiple sources and tries to group games together that are the same (not everyone writes release dates and games the same).
