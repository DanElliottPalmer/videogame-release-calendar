# Video Game Release Calendar

**This project is currently paused whilst I work out what todo with 2023. I suspect just update the URLs but I'll have a little think first.**

---

I wanted a way to quickly see what games are coming out without having to faff around, visiting multiple sites to check if they're correct. I also wanted it dead simple, easy to read and easy to find games. This is that attempt.

It pulls content from multiple sources and tries to group games together that are the same (not everyone writes release dates and games the same).
